Life Of a Meandering River
This repository was created by Tobias Hasse (tobiack@udel.edu) to host source code related to my thesis research.

This code is a Fork of Jon Schwenk's Life Of a Meander Bend (LOMB) source code published in conjunction with his fascinating article of the same name (citation forthcoming) 
Some of the main changes include adjustments to algorithms here and there to boost computational performance.
Writing portions of the code in c and compiling it for MATLAB
Truncating the algorithm to calculate the flowfield

This repo is specifically set up to be called by functions in my repositories MRDAST & MRLATS and will generate output files which are part of the analysis in the repositories MRDAST & MRVIST

A package of code files will be added to this repository at a later time
